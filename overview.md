# Brief history
![echOpen history](images/echopen-history.png)

echOpen was born in late 2014 as a community-based project bringing together people interested in mHealth devices and eHealth for the future of worldwide health. Having gathered a core team of 5 persons with necessary expertise for the project, we tested the feasibility (state of the art, potential applications, etc.). We then mobilized people of various professional backgrounds and partners to create an operational community based around 9 identified specific topics covering the entire project.
