# Basecamp

Basecamp is a project management tool. 

You'll find essentially two usages 

* "todo" : Basecamp offers a convenient way to categorize todo lists. This enables a panoramic view dashboard-like of current tasks adresses to each of the members of the team. 

* Threads : these are conversations about structured topics. Indeed, if Slack is the perfect tool to exchange informally on any subject, when a topic emerges and needs that member teams exchange in a more detailed and structured way, then Basecamp Messages are the right place to launch threads. 

* Basecamp offers also some daily alerts, inviting users to answer a daily question about "What did you work on today?", "See anything great lately that inspired you?". This is just perfect to maintain a team-builing rythm , and to keep all the community members informed of the advances.
