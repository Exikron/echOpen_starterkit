# Landing on the project

As echOpen is a community-based and an open source project, it's open to anyone with any interest, background and skills whatever you are from in the world, it's open and it will remain this way ! 

As the project is broad, any type of skills are welcome and useful. That is why we defined 9 main challenges to let anyone get into the project.
