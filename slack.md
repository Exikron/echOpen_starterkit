# Slack

Slack has become a communication standard tool. We find it even more conveninent than mailing lists. Slack is standalone place, dedicated to echOpen, allowing subject focus channels, in place of mailing lists -> no hassle of emails follow-ups. 

* The channels

We standardized our documentation tools in order to generate harmoniously all the echOpen doc. For those accustomed to developer tools, this is like a doxygen. In this spirit, we fixed some standard rules such as **convention naming**. 
All the projects, either there are on github repos or exists as slack channels share a common prefix : `prj_`

*If you're robot friendly, then you can script some that you'd consider to be relevant. It will be a joy ti test and adapot some robots in our family.*
