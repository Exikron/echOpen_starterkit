# Slack

Slack has become a communication standard tool. We find it even more conveninent than mailing lists. Slack is standalone place, dedicated to echOpen, allowing subject focus channels, in place of mailing lists -> no hassle of emails follow-ups. 

* The channels

We standardized our documentation tools in order to generate harmoniously all the echOpen doc. For those accustomed to developer tools, this is like a doxygen. In this spirit, we fixed some standard rules such as **convention naming**. 
All the projects, either there are on github repos or exists as slack channels share a common prefix : `prj_*`. 

So, in addition to the classical **general** and **random** channels that come bound to each slack project, you'll find the following entities

* [prj_com_website](https://echopen.slack.com/archives/prj_com_website) : dedicated to web site evolution focused on landing page and community enrollment

* [prj_commty_contrib](https://echopen.slack.com/archives/prj_commty_contrib) : dedicated to contribution valorisation, contributor charter and guide.

* [prj_commty_disseminat](https://echopen.slack.com/archives/prj_commty_disseminat) : dedicated to the "how to" dissemination at the kit level and at the community level  

* [prj_commty_is](https://echopen.slack.com/archives/prj_commty_is) : dedicated to discuss documentation methods and processes. This is the Information System of echOpen

* [prj_commty_workspace](https://echopen.slack.com/archives/prj_commty_workspace) : dedicated to making the echOpen HÃ´tel-Dieu location welcoming and friendly ;) if you're not in France, you should not worry about that.

* [prj_medtec_app](https://echopen.slack.com/archives/prj_medtec_app) : dedicated to the Android App development : UX, UI, back-end

* [prj_medtec_medical](https://echopen.slack.com/archives/prj_medtec_medical) : dedicated to all medical related issue : medical usages, probe ergonomy, clinical trials & such

* [prj_medtec_sigproc](https://echopen.slack.com/archives/prj_medtec_sigproc) : dedicated to  signal processing, image denoising software tools

* [prj_publichealth_mpct](https://echopen.slack.com/archives/prj_publichealth_mpct) : dedicated to echOpen's social impact and public health issues

* [prj_regul_norms](https://echopen.slack.com/archives/prj_regul_norms) : dedicated to norms and certifications issues

* [rules_and_process](https://echopen.slack.com/archives/rules_and_process) : dedicated to contributors rules and process for hardware, software and such. Outcome : a complete guide

* [events_capx_andsuch](https://echopen.slack.com/archives/events_capx_andsuch) : dedicated to organize and announce, events, workshops, hackathons & such

* [usb](https://echopen.slack.com/archives/usb) : channel to dedicated to USB data transfer, will survive ?

* 


*Remark* some of the channels do not begin by a `prj_` prefix. The reason that they are not project in the strict sense of the term and are not purposed to be included in a GitHub repo. **events_capx_andsuch**, related to organizing events is such an example.  

*If you're robot friendly, then you can script some that you'd consider to be relevant. It will be a joy ti test and adapot some robots in our family.*
