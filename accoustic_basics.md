In this section, we will explain some basis of the acoustic theory to understand the propagation of acoustic waves and the echographic process.

Propagation of acoustic waves
=============================

In this section, we will define the different types of acoustic waves and some basic equations and properties of the propagation of acoustic waves.

Wave types
----------

An acoustic wave is a perturbation of the local state without displacement of the global state. Acoustic waves are periodic, their spatial periodicity is given by the wavelength *Î»*. Consider a medium at rest such as on Fig. 1, where the particles are represented by the dots. Such a periodic structure represent a metal for example. When an acoustic wave propagate in this medium, the particles will have a local displacement.
