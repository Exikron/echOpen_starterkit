## Testing equipment

### Aquarium
The dimensions are determined in accordance with the focusing distance of the transducer. The tank must be transparent to be able to see what is being under test. 

### Phantoms
Ultrasound phantom models are used to reproduce the propagation variations observed in tissues.

### Propagation medium

The propagation medium is chosen so that:
waves can propagate easily, there is an impedance matching with the piezoelectric, it is similar to tissues generally under observation.
