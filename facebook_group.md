# Facebook group

Sure, you know everything about how a facebook group works. To get there, click [here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/echopen). You'll have to send a request. As soon as you're there, you'll find our online community. 

This space is where the community members share events, experiences, and other top stories. This feed is not only dedicated to echOpen *stricto sensu* news. All related news, comments, comments on comments, are welcome, as long as they are related to community subjects of concerns.

Sure, in there, all the common rules of courtesy, kindness and critical mind apply ;)
